# Income Hunt — Project Memory

## Design principles

### Checklist-first UX (user preference — important)
The user loves checklists. Whenever a widget surfaces a **list of items**, prefer the
checklist pattern over plain lists or dropdowns:
- Visible status per row (☐ / ✅), one tap to complete, completion is the "win" state.
- Apply this to: reminders, milestone badges (earned = ✅ with date, unearned = ☐ with
  the next threshold so the user sees what's next), expense category pickers (tappable
  chips, not dropdowns), and Uber "drive this window" intents.
- Empty states should point at the single next action ("Your first badge is one log away 🌱").

### Encouragement, never alarm
Behind-pace and missed-day states use **amber**, never red. Framing is loss-aversion but
supportive ("You're on a 5-day streak. One log keeps it alive.") — coach, not scold.

### Honesty over vanity metrics
Only display figures we can actually derive from logged data. Don't fabricate a
"net of mileage" rate when per-shift mileage isn't tracked — show gross $/hr (the real,
derivable number) instead.

## Architecture (do not rebuild)
- **DB:** SQLite via Promise helpers `run` / `get` / `all` in `backend/db.js`.
- **Idempotent fact log:** extracted facts deduped by `factKey`; experiment totals are always
  **re-derived** from the fact table in `finalizeAggregates()`, never incremented in place.
- **`finalizeAggregates()`** (`backend/ingest/applier.js`) is the single choke point — it
  recomputes path totals + expenses, applies text facts, writes a snapshot, awards
  milestones, and reverse-syncs the status file. Cron, manual Sync, and every CRUD route
  call it, so all aggregates and side effects stay consistent.
- **Reverse sync:** `backend/ingest/exporter.js` atomically writes `INCOME_HUNT_STATUS.md`
  (`.tmp` + rename) into each discovered memory dir so the user's Claude Desktop assistant
  always has fresh context. The ingest reader skips that filename to prevent a re-ingest loop.
- **Frontend widgets:** use the `Widget` shell + `theme.colors` + `AnimatedNumber` + `ChartCard`;
  self-poll with `useEffect` + `axios.get` + `setInterval` + silent `.catch(() => {})`.
- **Dashboard layout:** `react-grid-layout` with `lg`/`md`/`sm` breakpoints. The details toggle
  swaps between `layoutsFull` (all widgets) and `layoutsFocus` (6 primary widgets); detail
  widgets are conditionally rendered so RGL children always match the active layout.
- **Routing:** no router dependency — a lightweight hash router in `App.js` (`#/project/<id>`)
  switches between the dashboard and `ProjectPage`. Project pages are *additional* views; the
  dashboard is never replaced. `ProjectMenu` (topbar) lists active experiments and sets the hash.
- **Dark mode:** toggled by adding/removing `body.dark` (persisted in `localStorage` as `ms-dark`).
  All overrides live in `frontend/src/dark-mode.css` as `body.dark <selector>` rules — additive
  only, light mode untouched. Inline pastel chart colors stay as-is (they read fine on dark).
- **AI suggestions:** `POST /api/projects/:id/ideas` uses Claude Haiku when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  is set, else returns curated per-path "starter" ideas clearly labeled as such (never fake AI).

## Build / run
- Frontend: `cd frontend && CI=false npx react-scripts build`
- Backend: `cd backend && node server.js` (port 5000)
